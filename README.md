# Regression Analysis with Jupyter Notebooks

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks exploring various regression techniques. It serves as a practical guide and educational resource for understanding and implementing regression models.

## Project Overview

This project covers several key aspects of regression analysis, including:

*   **Linear Regression:** Simple and multiple linear regression models, including model evaluation and diagnostics.
*   **Polynomial Regression:** Modeling non-linear relationships using polynomial functions.
*   **Regularization Techniques (Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net):** Addressing overfitting and feature selection using regularization.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:** Using appropriate metrics like R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to assess model performance.
*   **Data Visualization:** Visualizing data and model predictions using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Notebooks

The following notebooks are included in this repository:

*   **`linear_regression.ipynb`:** Demonstrates simple and multiple linear regression with a focus on interpreting coefficients and assessing model fit.
*   **`polynomial_regression.ipynb`:** Explores how to model non-linear relationships using polynomial features and discusses the importance of model complexity.
*   **`regularization.ipynb`:** Covers Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net regression, explaining their impact on model coefficients and how to choose optimal regularization parameters.
*   **`data_exploration.ipynb`:** (Optional) If you have a dedicated notebook for EDA, describe it here. Example: Performs exploratory data analysis on the dataset used in the regression models.

## Datasets

The datasets used in these notebooks are either included in the repository (in a `data` folder, if applicable) or are publicly available and downloaded within the notebooks. If datasets are included, mention them here:

*   `data/house_prices.csv`: Contains information about house prices and various features, used for linear and potentially polynomial regression examples. (Example)
*   (Or mention how data is obtained if not included: e.g., using `sklearn.datasets` or downloaded from a specific URL.)

## Dependencies

The following Python libraries are required to run the notebooks:

*   `numpy`
*   `pandas`
*   `scikit-learn`
*   `matplotlib`
*   `seaborn`
*   `jupyter`

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
